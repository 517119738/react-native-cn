Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All the elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched. This is one of the primary reason a "web" app doesn't feel "native".

## Props 

**onLongPress** function 

**onPress** function 

Called when the touch is released, but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).

**onPressIn** function 

**onPressOut** function
